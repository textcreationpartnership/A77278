            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>For the firſt part of it, if your Petitioner ſhould humbly argumentize to your great Wiſdome, declared knowledge, publique invitations, and Inſtructions on the behalfe of the <hi>Lawes and Liberties,</hi> and what the nature of an Obligation and promiſe is, and how much the ſame is valued, by ſuch as have power or ability, and a good Conſcience with it, he thinks (with ſubmiſſion) it would be as needleſs as to caſt a drop of water into the Ocean, for thereby it will appeare, that he ſhould have had ſatisfaction for the ſame as a juſt debt, the obligation being of ſo Capitall and great a nature as <hi>Publique Faith,</hi> in which matter, if your Petitioner had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned juſt conſideration, he might have avoyded many great inconveniences, and made ſome juſt benefit thereof the juſt advantage and good of himſelf and relations, when he was arbitrarily excluded his publique Truſt, and ſo made inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of doing his Country ſervice in a publique way, and alſo if he had not been interrupted by his ſaid impriſonment; And if your Petitioner could be (as he hopeth he cannot be) induced to lay aſide (for his defence, and to juſtifie his claim, and particular juſt concernments) thoſe righteous <hi>Fundamental Lawes, Liberties and ancient Rights of the Nation,</hi> upon which the Warr was chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be grounded, (the conſervation of which Libertyes and Rights, was ſo diligently looked into by our honourable Parliamentary Aunceſters and fully eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; (upon rationall grounds and Maximes:) againſt any poſſibility of Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and by mutuall agreement from the Crowne of Monarchy,) yet Chriſt the head of all Chriſtians (from whom the name hath been ſince either really derived to any, or unjuſtly and improperly aſſumed by any) doth give as a law of Talion and everlaſting command (as I humbly conceive with ſubmiſſion to your great underſtanding) <hi>That every man ought to do as he would be done unto;</hi> not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any, or giving a Prerogative or Previledge to any whomſoever upon any Politicall ſuggeſtion or pretence whatſoever to diſanul that Law.</p>
               <p>And how indubitably neceſſary it is that <hi>Law</hi> ſhould be a ſupreame barr, againſt arbitrarineſs; and how conſiſtent the Evangelicall Law is with the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and with the juſt concernment of every mans juſt intereſt and defence, and how upon due impartial reaſoning this may be applyed, and by how much the more the Rule is obligeing to the greateſt Authorities or Powers in a more eſpecial
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:135182:2"/>manner, (as eminent examples to others) your Petitioner doth referr to your Conſcience, and declared knowledge without uſeing other arguments.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond part of it your Petitioner did (as he hopeth) in as model. Termes, as he could imagine or conceive (with laying aſide flattery, which is hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the wiſely juſt) defire conſideration of his ſaid almoſt three yeares Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, as if the caſe had been your own, and as if God ſhould have permitted the late deceaſed call'd Protector, NOT ONELY TO INTERRUPT YOU, BUT TO COMMIT YOU EVERY ONE AS YOU DID HIM; which ſaid Impriſonment hath tended in many conſiderations to his injury, great loſs, many inconveniences, ruine, and deſtruction ever ſince; in ſo much that your Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hath often (in affliction of mind, and peradventure with too great and deep a ſenſe and conſideration of things) deſired diſſolution, as that good Prophet <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> (with whom your Petitioner cannot compare) requeſted for himſelf that he might dye, and ſaid <hi>it is enough now oh Lord, take away my life for I am not better then my Fathers,</hi> for after the long defect of Juſtice, and humane conſideration in a moderate nature (which was onely deſired by your Petitioner?) your Petitioner can onely aſcribe thanks to the great goodneſs of God for his preſervation to this day, which he yet hopeth hath been in goodneſs, that he may after ſo long a time reap your Juſtice, that humane nature ſhould not be neglected and trampled upon any longer. And for Argument to your declared exemplary underſtanding, your Petitioner (hoping it may receive a revived Impreſſion) deſires to mind you with your own Declarations in anſwer to the late King <hi>Charles,</hi> which will reſtifie for him, and plead his cauſe, as will appear in the book of Collection of Declarations, Printed by Mr. <hi>Edward Husbands</hi> by order, and direction of the 24 <hi>March</hi> 1642 <hi>Page</hi> 694; Wherein you expreſs your ſelves in this manner, <hi>(viz.) Whatever be our inclination, Slavery would be our condition, if we ſhould go about to overthrow the Laws of the Land, and the Propriety of every mans Estate, and Liberty of his Perſon; for therein we muſt be aswell Patients as Agents; and must every one in his turn ſuffer our ſelves whatever we ſhould impoſe upon others:</hi> And in your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the 19th of <hi>May</hi> 1642, <hi>Page</hi> 202, wherein you expreſſe theſe words, <hi>(viz,) And as his Majesty doth gratiouſly declare the Law ſhall be the meaſure of his Power, ſo do we hearttly profeſs, that we ſhall alwaies make it the Rule of our Obedience.</hi> And therefore, as Chriſt that perfect Pattern of natural Juſtice and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Power and Mercy, <hi>John</hi> 5.30. doth uſe theſe words, <hi>(viz.) As I hear I judge, and my Judgment is just becauſe I ſeek not mine own will, but the will of my Father which hath ſent me:</hi> So I humbly ſuppoſe I may ſay and apply, as I have heard or read in the righteous Foundations and Principles of the Law from our Anceſtors, and alſo averted by your own Writings. As I hear, I Judge and believe there is a Rule of direction to me to beleive my judgment is juſt, becauſe I ſeek not my own Will, grounded (as an Innovation) upon my own Judgment or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate opinion, but founded upon your own Declarations which teſtifie to the Caſe.</p>
               <p>As for the third part of your Petitioners aforeſaid Application, he doth humbly confeſs ſince he did ſee a great or generall endeavours and application for a reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and reinveſtiture to Government, and to accept of Truſts and places of profit, <hi>Power,</hi> and imployment, he could not think his ſaid addreſs to be any juſt cauſe of offence to you (as the caſe is,) but rather receiveable with chearfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to do Juſtice. But your Petitioner ſeeing and continually feeling (after 11 years ſufferings and neglects, that his ſaid Application of the 18th of <hi>June</hi> was ineffectuall, he made another of the ſecond of <hi>July</hi> following, and apprehending that his place of truſt, and inveſtiture might not be with your likeing, did not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly mind that third part of his ſaid addreſſe, being willing to endeavour pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of mind and ſubjection, rather then any ſuch thing as any part or portion in YOUR GOVERNMENT.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:135182:3"/>
               <p> Therefore your Petitioner doth now againe (by all obligations humane and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine) requeſt and deſire of you to manifeſt a Preſidentall or exemplary Juſtice, and good Conſcience ſuitable to a great Counſell, as to the ſpeedy conſideration of his arreares, loſſes, dammages and diſburſements (intendedly for your lawfull preſervation) and ſpeedy and juſt ſatisfaction for his almoſt three years <hi>arbitrary Impriſonment,</hi> that ſo he might not be any longer neglected, deſtroyed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, contrary to the Rules of all juſt Law, Humanity and Conſcience, and in caſe your ſaid oppreſſed Petitioner ſhall obtaine Juſtice (in his affection and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, he deſires to beare to gratitude,) he ſhall pray that God would extend his Wiſdome, and the power of his God-head to and for you and your poſterity, if you or they ſhall have any occaſion to deſire or expect Juſtice and goodneſs from any future Government, Authority or Generations in the World.</p>
